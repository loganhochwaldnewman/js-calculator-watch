3. Right-click the `index.html` file and Open With Live Server.

## Adding JavaScript Functionality

Once you have set up the HTML structure, it's time to add JavaScript functionality to your calculator watch. Follow these steps:

1. Open the `script.js` file in your code editor.
2. Implement the necessary JavaScript functions to perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and handle user input.
3. Test your calculator watch to ensure that it performs the desired calculations accurately.

## Styling with CSS

After adding functionality with JavaScript, it's time to make your calculator watch visually appealing using CSS. Follow these steps:

2. Add CSS styles to customize the appearance of your calculator watch. You can change colors, fonts, layout, and more.
3. Test your calculator watch to ensure that it looks good and is responsive across different screen sizes.

## Testing and Debugging

Throughout the development process, it's important to test your calculator watch thoroughly and debug any issues that arise. Use browser developer tools and console.log statements to identify and fix bugs in your code.
